ZFKit - Zend Framework Starter Kit
==================================
Original code - copyright (c)2010 Michael Kimsal
All other code copyright by the respective projects

ZFKit provides a basic skeleton for bringing 
together doctrine, phpunit and zend framework in one 
'ready to go' set up.

Doctrine 1.2 is provided in the /library folder, 
but Zend Framework will need to be provided by you directly.
You can symlink it in to /library or copy it directly.

You'll need to symlink such that /library/Zend is pointing 
at your /library from the ZendFramework installation.

ln -s /path/to/zfkit/library/Zend /path/to/real/zendframework/library/Zend

or 

cp -r /path/to/real/zendframework/library/Zend /path/to/zfkit/library/
