ZFKit - Zend Framework Starter Kit
==================================
Original code - copyright (c)2010 Michael Kimsal
All other code copyright by the respective projects

ZFKit provides a basic skeleton for bringing 
together doctrine, phpunit and zend framework in one 
'ready to go' set up.

Doctrine 1.2 is provided in the /library folder, 
but Zend Framework will need to be provided by you directly.
You can symlink it in to /library or copy it directly.


Getting started
===============
You'll need to symlink such that /library/Zend is pointing 
at your /library from the ZendFramework installation.

ln -s /path/to/zfkit/library/Zend /path/to/real/zendframework/library/Zend

or 

cp -r /path/to/real/zendframework/library/Zend /path/to/zfkit/library/

-------

Make your web server virtual host point to the public/ folder of your 
starter kit project.

Something like this would be appropriate
<VirtualHost *:80>
	DocumentRoot "/path/to/git/checkout/of/zfkit/public"
	ServerName <your_host_name_here>
	Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
	<Directory "/path/to/git/checkout/of/zfkit">
		Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

-------

Go in to the scripts directory and run the ./run script
This will automatically drop/create the database, create a schema
and insert sample data, based on the Doctrine data in /application/data
(specifically, the schema.yml and fixtures/data.yml files)

-------

Visit your hostname

http://<your_host_name_here>/
