ZFKit - Zend Framework Starter Kit
==================================
Original code - copyright (c)2010 Michael Kimsal
All other code copyright by the respective projects

ZFKit provides a basic skeleton for bringing 
together doctrine, phpunit and Zend Framework in one 
'ready to go' set up.

Doctrine 1.2 and ZF 1.10.5 are provided in the /library folder, 


Getting started
===============
ZF libraries are provided in a tgz format.  You'll need to untar/unzip
them before starting.

cd /path/to/zfkit/library
tar -xzf Zend.tgz

-or-

If you want to provide your own ZF library, symlink or 
copy the Zend library from ZF to live in the zfkit/library folder.

ln -s /path/to/zfkit/library/Zend /path/to/real/zendframework/library/Zend

or 

cp -r /path/to/real/zendframework/library/Zend /path/to/zfkit/library/

-------

You may wish to make your /public/ folder the document root 
of a virtual host for nicer URLs.

Something like this would be appropriate
<VirtualHost *:80>
	DocumentRoot "/path/to/git/checkout/of/zfkit/public"
	ServerName <your_host_name_here>
	Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
	<Directory "/path/to/git/checkout/of/zfkit">
		Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

-------

DB setup
Go in to the scripts directory and run the ./run script
This will automatically drop/create the database, create a schema
and insert sample data, based on the Doctrine data in /application/data
(specifically, the schema.yml and fixtures/data.yml files)

-------

Visit your hostname

http://<your_host_name_here>/
