## 4.1.5

* Fixes a bug in touch interaction controls discovered and fixed by @lxbarth

## 4.1.4

* Calls callbacks with `evt` argument from `wax.ol.interaction`
* Strict interaction: doesn't tolerate actions that are on
  elements that are not actually map tiles. This changes behavior
  significantly

## 4.1.0

* Adds `wax.ol.connector`, an OpenLayers connector

## 4.0.0

* Removes `wax.Record`, which has been deprecated in favor of templating,
  TileJSON, and possibly albums
* Removes interaction autoconfiguration - you should use the
  `wax.tilejson()` instead to provide these details up-front.
* Removes OpenLayers embedder and switcher controls. Embedder was deprecated
  by changes in embedding strategy and map-exchanging should be used
  instead of layer switching.

## 3.1.0

* Adds new formatter api: TileJSON with a `version=1.2` key and `template`
  data will now be templated with Mustache and sent through `html-sanitizer`

### 3.0.9

* Added `wax.g.hash()` control
* Moved hash fundamentals to `control/lib/hash.js` and utilities to `utils.js`

### 3.0.6

* Update [reqwest](https://github.com/ded/reqwest) to 0.2.7 for IE9 compatibility.
* Parse `matrix()` CSS transforms for IE9 compatibility.
* Fix to `wax.mm.interaction()` on dragging outside of the map.

### 3.0.5

### 3.0.1

* Expose `#full` and `#original` methods on `wax.mm.fullscreen` allowing API
  access to fullscreen toggling actions.
* Fixes to boxselector and zoombox controls.

### 3.0.0

* TileJSON support in new map connectors: `wax.mm.connector`,
  `wax.leaf.connector` and `wax.g.connector`. The old `wax.g.maptype` and
  `wax.mm.provider` have been removed.
* All `g`, `leaf` and `mm` controls now use the signature
  `function (map, tilejson, options) {}` where relevant TileJSON keys in
  `tilejson` are used if present and `options` contains settings specific to
  the control.
* Fullscreen, zoomer, attribution and legend controls no longer automatically
  append themselves to the map div. Use the `.appendTo` method to add the DOM
  element to the map or to another element on the page.
* `w.melt(func)` now has the same return value as `func`.

_2.x.x_

```javascript
var provider = new wax.mm.provider({
    baseUrl: 'http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox/',
    layerName: 'natural-earth-2'});
var map = ...;
wax.mm.legend(map);
```

_3.x.x_

```javascript
var connector = new wax.mm.connector({
    tiles: 'http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox/1.0.0/natural-earth-2/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
    scheme: 'tms'
    });
var map = ...;
wax.mm.legend(map, { legend: 'Content' }).appendTo(map.parent);

  called with the map as the first argument and an options object as the second
